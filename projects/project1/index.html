      For those of us who live at the shoreline
      standing upon the constant edges of decision
      crucial and alone
      for those of us who cannot indulge
      the passing dreams of choice
      who love in doorways coming and going
      in the hours between dawns
      looking inward and outward
      at once before and after
      seeking a now that can breed
      futures
      like bread in our childrens mouths
      so their dreams will not reflect
      the death of ours;
    </span>
    </p>
    <p id="text3" class="text">
      For those of us
      who were imprinted with fear
      like a faint line in the center of our foreheads
      learning to be afraid with our motherâ€™s milk
      for by this weapon
      this illusion of some safety to be found
      the heavy-footed hoped to silence us
      For all of us
      this instant and this triumph
      We were never meant to survive.
    </p>
    <p id="text4" class="text">
      And when the sun rises we are afraid
      it might not remain
      when the sun sets we are afraid
      it might not rise in the morning
      when our stomachs are full we are afraid
      of indigestion
      when our stomachs are empty we are afraid
      we may never eat again
      when we are loved we are afraid
      love will vanish
      when we are alone we are afraid
      love will never return
      and when we speak we are afraid
      our words will not be heard
      nor welcomed
      but when we are silent
      we are still afraid
       
      So it is better to speak
      remembering
      we were never meant to survive.
    </p>
